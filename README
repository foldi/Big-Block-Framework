Updates in 6.2:
1. added BigBlock.standalone property in core_object_init.js. Set to true if app is running as a full screen iPhone web app launched from the home screen.

2. added loading_list and loading_complete properties to track loading audio files; if BigBlock.Audio.loading_complete = true, all files have loaded.


Updates in 6.1:

1. In Timer.run(), removed a condition around BigBlock.RenderMgr.renderCleanUp() so the function is always called.

2. Fixed an error in BigBlock.ptInsideRect() that caused rendering errors near the bottom and right edges of the viewport.

3. Updated checkButtonAction() in ScreenEvent to send the object in Button.map to the action_input of the button that was clicked/touched.

4. Updated check for Timer.is_paused in ScreenEvent; now occurs after ScreenEvent checks.


Planned updates for .7 release:

1. Add water and snow emitter configurations to library_emitter.js.

2. Organize the anim property like below to remove the 'c' key. Use the name of the color palette:

anim = [

	{
		frm: {
			duration: 1,
			blk: {
				'white': 0,
				'i': 40*1
			},
			label: 'first frame'
		}		
	}

];

3. Add Interface to test for required properties.

4. Add particle_max property to Emitter; should stop emitting after particle count > particle max.

5. Add old game platform color palettes like Atari, Commodore 64, etc.

6. Remove Header and Footer classes.
