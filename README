Copyright (C) 2011 Foldi, LLC

Big Block Framework is a standards-compliant JavaScript framework for rendering pixel art, pixel fonts and particles in a web browser.

The current release is bigblock-alpha-.6.5.js.

See documentation in /docs/index.html and demos in /demos/index.html

////
Updates in 6.5:
1. Updated Log object to include methods in the Firebug API like timer, count and table.

2. To output average framerate, set BigBlock.Log.timer_enabled = true in the console or in BigBlock.ready

3. Added Interface to check for required params.

4. Added ImagePreloader to preload images. Use fetch(params) and pass an array of objects that describes the images to preload:

BigBlock.ImagePreloader.fetch([		
	{
		path : "/images/", 
		name : "screen001",
		extension: ".png"
	}	
]);


////
Updates in 6.4:
1. Several performance enhancements including using only one div per viewport layer rather than four. A layer with four divs loaded faster. However, using one div doubled the frame rate because less dom operations were required to render the frame.

2. Added a BG viewport layer that can accept image files for use and background images. Example: BigBlock.GridBG.setStyle("backgroundImage", "url(screen001.png)");


Updates in 6.2:
1. added BigBlock.standalone property in core_object_init.js. Set to true if app is running as a full screen iPhone web app launched from the home screen.

2. added loading_list and loading_complete properties to track loading audio files; if BigBlock.Audio.loading_complete = true, all files have loaded.


Updates in 6.1:

1. In Timer.run(), removed a condition around BigBlock.RenderMgr.renderCleanUp() so the function is always called.

2. Fixed an error in BigBlock.ptInsideRect() that caused rendering errors near the bottom and right edges of the viewport.

3. Updated checkButtonAction() in ScreenEvent to send the object in Button.map to the action_input of the button that was clicked/touched.

4. Updated check for Timer.is_paused in ScreenEvent; now occurs after ScreenEvent checks.


Planned updates for .7 release:

1. Add water and snow emitter configurations to library_emitter.js.

2. Organize the anim property like below to remove the 'c' key. Use the name of the color palette:

anim = [

	{
		frm: {
			duration: 1,
			blk: {
				'white': 0,
				'i': 40*1
			},
			label: 'first frame'
		}		
	}

];

3. Add Interface to test for required properties.

4. Add particle_max property to Emitter; should stop emitting after particle count > particle max.

5. Add old game platform color palettes like Atari, Commodore 64, etc.

6. Remove Header and Footer classes.

7. Add JSDoc tags.
