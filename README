////

Updates in 6.1:

1. In Timer.run(), removed a condition around BigBlock.RenderMgr.renderCleanUp() so the function is always called.

2. Fixed an error in BigBlock.ptInsideRect() that caused rendering errors near the bottom and right edges of the viewport.

3. Updated checkButtonAction() in ScreenEvent to send the object in Button.map to the action_input of the button that was clicked/touched.

4. Updated check for Timer.is_paused in ScreenEvent; now occurs after ScreenEvent checks.


Planned updates for .7 release:

1. Add water and snow emitter configurations to library_emitter.js.

2. Organize the anim property like below to remove the 'c' key. Just use the name of the color palette:

anim = [

	{
		frm: {
			duration: 1,
			blk: {
				'white': 0,
				'i': 40*1
			},
			label: 'first frame'
		}		
	}

];

3. Add Interface to test for required properties.

4. Add particle_max property to Emitter; should stop emitting after particle count > particle max.
